## Experiment 5
## Theory:
Control structures in C++ let you decide which code to run based on certain conditions:

if: Runs a block of code if a condition is true.
else: Runs a block of code if the previous if condition is false.
else if: Checks another condition if the previous if condition was false. You can have multiple else if conditions.
switch: Compares a variable against a set of values (cases) and runs the code for the matching case. If no cases match, it runs the default block (if provided).
### Program 1
### Aim:
To determine if a number is even, odd, or zero.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

### Output:
The program will display whether the number is even, odd, or zero.

### Program 2
Aim:
To find the largest of two numbers.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

### Output:
The program will show which of the two numbers is larger.

### Program 3
### Aim:
To check if a given year is a leap year.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

### Output:
The program will indicate whether the entered year is a leap year.

### Program 4
### Aim:
To validate a password.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

### Output:
The program will verify if the entered password is correct.

### Program 5
### Aim:
To display the days of the week based on user input.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

### Output:
The program will show the name of the day corresponding to the user's input.

### Program 6
### Aim:
To create a simple calculator using switch statements.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

### Output:
The program will perform arithmetic operations based on user input.

### Program 7
### Aim:
To evaluate and display grades based on user input.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

### Output:
The program will show the grade corresponding to the entered score.

### Conclusion:
We explored decision-making statements in C++ and learned how to use them in various scenarios.
